Highlights from this mock snapshot:\n- Most profitable products: Premium Hoodie and Ceramic Mug lead by profit and healthy margins; Enamel Pin has strong margin percentage but smaller absolute profit due to lower volume.\n- Best channels: Shopify and Amazon contribute most profit; Instagram has a solid margin but lower scale.\n- Margins: Average gross margin sits around 36–38% in this sample; products below 30% (like Basic Tee) may benefit from price or cost tweaks.\n- Trend: Revenue stayed above costs across the period with a slight dip mid-month; profit line would mirror the gap between them.\n\nWant me to plug in your real data? If you can share your date range, currency, sales/cost exports (or connect Amazon/Shopify/Etsy), I’ll render your live dashboard. You can also tell me which channels or products to filter, and I’ll narrow the view."

Once you share the files, I’ll render your live dashboard.\n\nWhat to export (two CSVs)\n1) Sales (orders/line-items) CSV\n- order_id: Unique order number (string)\n- order_date: ISO date-time (e.g., 2025-10-03T14:22:01Z)\n- channel: One of [shopify, etsy, amazon]\n- line_item_id: Unique line item id (string)\n- product_id: Your SKU or product handle (string)\n- product_name: Display name (string)\n- quantity: Units sold (number)\n- unit_price: Price per unit before discounts (number)\n- line_discount_amount: Total discount applied to this line item (number)\n- shipping_revenue: Amount collected for shipping on this order (number)\n- tax_amount: Tax collected (number)\n- refund_amount: Refunded amount for this line item (number, 0 if none)\n- channel_fee: Fees attributable to this order (e.g., marketplace fees, number)\n- fulfillment_cost: Pick/pack/fulfillment cost for this order (number)\n- ad_cost: Ad spend attributable (if you have per-order attribution; else leave blank or 0)\n- tags: Optional free-form tags/coupon codes (string)\n\n2) COGS (costs per product) CSV\n- product_id: SKU that matches Sales CSV\n- cogs_per_unit: Your unit cost (number)\n- effective_start_date: When this cost becomes valid (ISO date)\n- effective_end_date: Optional (ISO date) for when it changes; leave blank if current\n- notes: Optional comments\n\nNotes and flexibility\n- If your costs vary by batch, include multiple rows with date ranges. I’ll match order_date to the right COGS window.\n- If you don’t track fulfillment_cost or ad_cost per order, include them at the channel level in a separate note and I can prorate by revenue or orders.\n\nDiscount exclusion options (choose one or more)\n- Threshold: Exclude orders/line-items where discount_rate >= X% (e.g., 40%). I calculate discount_rate as line_discount_amount / (unit_price * quantity).\n- Coupon code: Exclude orders containing specific codes (e.g., BFCM50, STAFF, FRIENDS).\n- Order tags: Exclude orders with tags like employee, promo, giveaway.\n- Absolute: Exclude if line_discount_amount >= $Y.\nTell me your preferred rule(s) and the threshold(s), and I’ll apply them to all visuals and KPIs.\n\nNext step\n- Upload the two CSVs using the column headers above (a sample of 10–20 rows is fine to start). If you have channel-level fees or ads not tied to orders, share those totals per channel for the 90-day window and I’ll allocate them.\n\nWhile we wait for the files, here’s the dashboard scaffold set to last 90 days and your channels. It will populate automatically once data is ingested."
